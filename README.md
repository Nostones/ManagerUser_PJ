In this project, I generated SQL data myself, used a three-tier architecture, and employed Java Spring Boot to handle the backend code (writing APIs, handling logic, security, etc.). For the frontend, I utilized Ajax to call APIs and also employed Bootstrap and JQuery libraries to display data on the screen. The code is complete for a small FullStack project.
